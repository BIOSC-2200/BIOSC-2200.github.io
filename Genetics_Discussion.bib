  abstract = "Despite enormous efforts employing various approaches, the
              molecular pathology in the schizophrenia brain remains elusive.
              On the other hand, the knowledge of the association between the
              disease risk and changes in the DNA sequences, in other words,
              our understanding of the genetic pathology of schizophrenia, has
              dramatically improved over the past two decades. As the
              consequence, now we can explain more than 20\% of the liability
              to schizophrenia by considering all analyzable common genetic
              variants including those with weak or no statistically
              significant association. Also, a large-scale exome sequencing
              study identified single genes whose rare mutations substantially
              increase the risk for schizophrenia, of which six genes (SETD1A,
              CUL1, XPO7, GRIA3, GRIN2A, and RB1CC1) showed odds ratios larger
              than ten. Based on these findings together with the preceding
              discovery of copy number variants (CNVs) with similarly large
              effect sizes, multiple disease models with high etiological
              validity have been generated and analyzed. Studies of the brains
              of these models, as well as transcriptomic and epigenomic
              analyses of patient postmortem tissues, have provided new
              insights into the molecular pathology of schizophrenia. In this
              review, we overview the current knowledge acquired from these
              studies, their limitations, and directions for future research
              that may redefine schizophrenia based on biological alterations

  abstract = "There has been substantial progress in understanding the genetics
              of schizophrenia over the past 15 years. This has revealed a
              highly polygenic condition with the majority of the currently
              explained heritability coming from common alleles of small effect
              but with additional contributions from rare copy number and
              coding variants. Many specific genes and loci have been
              implicated that provide a firm basis upon which mechanistic
              research can proceed. These point to disturbances in neuronal,
              and particularly synaptic, functions that are not confined to a
              small number of brain regions and circuits. Genetic findings have
              also revealed the nature of schizophrenia's close relationship to
              other conditions, particularly bipolar disorder and childhood
              neurodevelopmental disorders, and provided an explanation for how
              common risk alleles persist in the population in the face of
              reduced fecundity. Current genomic approaches only potentially
              explain around 40\% of heritability, but only a small proportion
              of this is attributable to robustly identified loci. The extreme
              polygenicity poses challenges for understanding biological
              mechanisms. The high degree of pleiotropy points to the need for
              more transdiagnostic research and the shortcomings of current
              diagnostic criteria as means of delineating biologically distinct
              strata. It also poses challenges for inferring causality in
              observational and experimental studies in both humans and model
              systems. Finally, the Eurocentric bias of genomic studies needs
              to be rectified to maximise benefits and ensure these are felt
              across diverse communities. Further advances are likely to come
              through the application of new and emerging technologies, such as
              whole-genome and long-read sequencing, to large and diverse
              samples. Substantive progress in biological understanding will
              require parallel advances in functional genomics and proteomics
              applied to the brain across developmental stages. For these
              efforts to succeed in identifying disease mechanisms and defining
              novel strata they will need to be combined with sufficiently
              granular phenotypic data.",

              tentatively suggest that if students learn about the complexity

              article, we investigate for the first time how different types of

               racial groups, it can augment their racial biases. However,
               there is apparently no research that explores if the reverse is
               possible. Does teaching adolescents scientifically accurate
               information about genetic variation within and between US census
               races reduce their racial biases? We randomized 8th and 9th
               grade students (n?=?166) into separate classrooms to learn for
               an entire week either about the topics of (a) human genetic
               variation or (b) climate variation. In a cross-over randomized
               trial with clustering, we demonstrate that when students learn
               about genetic variation within and between racial groups it
               significantly changes their perceptions of human genetic
               variation, thereby causing a significant decrease in their
               scores on instruments assessing cognitive forms of prejudice. We
               then replicate these findings in two computer-based randomized
               controlled trials, one with adults (n?=?176) and another with
               biology students (n?=?721, 9th?12th graders). These results
               indicate that teaching about human variation in the domain of
               genetics has potentially powerful effects on social cognition
               during adolescence. In turn, we argue that learning about the
               social and quantitative complexities of human genetic variation
               research could prepare students to become informed participants
               in a society where human genetics is invoked as a rationale in

              opportunities for practice, and immediate, individualized

              MathBench modules to improve student quantitative skills and
              their attitudes towards the integration of math and biology in a
              community college introductory biology course, where instructors
              face multiple challenges to integrating quantitative content. Ten

              sections covered the same laboratory and lecture content without

              engaging in the task (e.g., extra effort, anxiety), influence
              their achievement and academic-related choices. Further, these
              task values are theorized to be informed by students'
              sociocultural background. Although biology students are often
              considered to be math-averse, there is little empirical evidence
              of students' values of mathematics in the context of biology
              (math-biology task values). To fill this gap in knowledge, we
              sought to determine 1) life science majors' math-biology task
              values, 2) how math-biology task values differ according to
              students' sociocultural background, and 3) whether math-biology
              task values predict students' likelihood of taking quantitative
              biology courses. We surveyed life science majors about their
              likelihood of choosing to take quantitative biology courses and
              their interest in using mathematics to understand biology, the
              utility value of mathematics for their life science career, and
              the cost of doing mathematics in biology courses. Students on
              average reported some cost associated with doing mathematics in
              biology; however, they also reported high utility value and were
              more interested in using mathematics to understand biology than
              previously believed. Women and first-generation students reported
              more negative math-biology task values than men and
              continuing-generation students. Finally, students' math-biology
              task values predicted their likelihood of taking biomodeling and
              biostatistics courses. Instructional strategies promoting
              positive math-biology task values could be particularly
              beneficial for women and first-generation students, increasing
              the likelihood that students would choose to take advanced
              quantitative biology courses.",

              interviews in one semester to examine how students at different
              levels approached quantitative problems. We found that students
              improved in all skills in most semesters, although there was
              variation in the degree of improvement among skills from semester
              to semester. One demographic variable, transfer status, stood out
              as a major predictor of the degree to which students improved
              (transfer students achieved much lower gains every semester,
              despite the fact that pretest scores in each focus area were
              similar between transfer and nontransfer students). We propose

               conceptions of evolution and their relationships to acceptance
               of evolution. Proficiency in statistical and probabilistic
               reasoning has long been considered to be an essential feature of
               evolutionary reasoning, yet almost no empirical work has
               explored these putative connections. The RaPro instruments have
               recently been developed to measure statistical reasoning in the
               contexts of mathematics (RaProMath) and evolution (RaProEvo).
               Our study provides additional validation of these instruments
               using Rasch analysis and quantifies the contribution of
               statistical reasoning to both understanding and accepting
               evolution. We recruited a large sample (N?=?564) of
               undergraduate students enrolled in an introductory biology
               course at a large public research university in the United
               States. Students completed a suite of published instruments that
               assessed statistical reasoning, evolutionary understanding, and
               evolutionary acceptance. Our findings indicate that validity
               inferences derived from RaPro scores generalized to the new
               sample, and that proficiency in statistical reasoning explained
               28\% of the variance in evolutionary knowledge and 19\% of the
               variation in evolutionary acceptance. The inclusion of
               demographic variables into the model significantly increased the
               explained variance in acceptance. Notably, the variance in
               evolution acceptance explained by statistical reasoning was
               comparable to that of thinking dispositions or evolutionary
               knowledge reported in the literature. This work provides the
               first large-scale evidence of the role of statistical reasoning
               in evolutionary knowledge and acceptance and motivates future

               alike. In order to produce graduates that are well-prepared for
               quantitative research, overcoming the initial hurdles associated
               with statistical programming is a must. Often, valuable class
               time is dedicated to teaching introductory concepts of
               statistical programming, leaving instructors short on time. Here
               we present an introductory tutorial to statistical programming
               in the language R. Our tutorial is easily customizable,
               self-paced, and can be used in secondary through graduate level
               classrooms. Student questionnaire responses suggest that
               perceptions towards R became generally more favorable following
               an introduction to the program, with an increased likelihood of
               returning to R. Similar results were found across multiple
               formats for introducing statistical programming in R and suggest
               a tutorial-style introduction is as effective as a series of
               lectures and computer exercises for altering student perceptions

              embed them into interactive tools with which one can visually
              evaluate model structures and directly explore model outcomes
              through simulation. To promote such interactive learning of
              quantitative models, we developed EcoEvoApps, a collection of
              free, open-source, and multilingual R/Shiny apps that include
              model overviews, interactive model simulations, and code to
              implement these models directly in R. The package currently
              focuses on canonical models of population dynamics, species
              interactions, and landscape ecology. These apps help illustrate
              fundamental results from theoretical ecology and can serve as
              valuable teaching tools in classroom settings. We present data
              from student surveys which show that students rate these apps as
              useful learning tools, and that using interactive apps leads to
              substantial gains in students' interest and confidence in working
              with mathematical models. This points to the potential for
              interactive activities to make theoretical models more accessible
              to a wider audience, and thus facilitate the feedback between
              theory and data across ecology and evolutionary biology.",

              process variables were examined: metacognitive skills,
              collaborative skills, genetics knowledge, and academic
              achievement. A quasi-experimental research design was used to
              compare the MSCL (n = 30) and MS (n = 30) groups in which each
              group consisted of low (n = 15)-ability and high (n = 15)-ability
              students. Results showed that MSCL group portrayed higher
              collaborative skills but lower metacognitive skills than MS
              group. However, both groups had no influences on other variables:
              genetics knowledge and academic achievements. In addition,

  abstract  = "Abstract Basic quantitative and population genetics topics are
               typically taught in introductory plant breeding courses and are
               critical for success in upper-level study. Active learning,
               including simulations and games, may be useful for instruction
               of these concepts, which rely heavily on theory and may be more
               challenging for students. The statistical computing language R
               is now routinely used in the analysis of plant breeding
               experiments, but the command-line interface of the language may
               be unsuitable for an introductory course. Here we describe
               qgshiny (quantitative genetics in shiny), an interactive
               application for performing simulations to understand basic
               theory in quantitative and population genetics. The initial
               version of the application includes modules on three core topics
               in quantitative genetics: randomly mating populations, genetic
               variance, and response to selection. Students can specify
               parameters and initiate simulations to assess their impact on
               responses such as allele frequency, genetic variance, and
               genetic gain, which together can be used to reinforce more
               general learning objectives. Feedback collected from students
               after engaging with the application suggests this tool can have
               a positive impact on student learning. The application is

               forward simulation has been widely used in population genetics.
               However, it has been largely restricted to modeling only a
               single species, which has limited its broader utility in
               evolutionary biology. Indeed, to our knowledge no
               general-purpose, flexible modeling framework exists that
               provides support for simulating multiple species while also
               providing other key features, such as explicit genetics and
               continuous space. The lack of such software has limited our
               ability to model higher biological levels such as communities,
               ecosystems, coevolutionary and eco-evolutionary processes, and
               biodiversity, which is crucial for many purposes, from extending

              the most powerful and widely used tools in this area. However,
              its foundation in the Wright-Fisher model has been found to pose
              an obstacle to implementing many types of models; it is difficult

              overlapping generations, individual variation in reproduction,
              density-dependent population regulation, individual variation in

              easy implementation of all of the above scenarios and many more.

              spatial interactions and spatial maps of environmental variables.
