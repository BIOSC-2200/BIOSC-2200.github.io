                 An apparent Mendelian recessive, the ``mini-muscle'' (MM)
                 allele, whose main phenotypic effect is to reduce hindlimb
                 muscle mass by 50\%, was discovered in 2 HR lines and 1 C
                 line. This gene of major effect has gone to fixation in one
                 selected line, remains polymorphic in another, and is now
                 undetectable in the one C line. Homozygotes exhibit various

                 selection (10 generations of artificial selection for high
                 voluntary activity on running wheels) and access to running
                 wheels (7-8 weeks) elicited a modest increase in maximal
                 oxygen consumption. Based on these results, we hypothesized
                 that genetic selection would affect the changes in endurance
                 and oxidative capacity of the medial gastrocnemius (MG) muscle
                 induced by wheel access (training response). Wheel access
                 increased the isotonic endurance of the MG in both genetically
                 selected and random-bred (control) mice. However, this
                 exercise-induced improvement in isotonic endurance of the MG
                 was similar between genetically selected and control mice.
                 Wheel access also increased the succinate dehydrogenase
                 activity of MG muscle fibers in both selected and control
                 lines. However, this exercise-induced increase in succinate

                 indicate that the modest increase in maximal oxygen

  abstract    = "Most common human traits and diseases have a polygenic pattern
                 of inheritance: DNA sequence variants at many genetic loci
                 influence the phenotype. Genome-wide association (GWA) studies
                 have identified more than 600 variants associated with human
                 traits, but these typically explain small fractions of
                 phenotypic variation, raising questions about the use of
                 further studies. Here, using 183,727 individuals, we show that
                 hundreds of genetic variants, in at least 180 loci, influence
                 adult height, a highly heritable and classic polygenic trait.
                 The large number of loci reveals patterns with important
                 implications for genetic studies of common human diseases and
                 traits. First, the 180 loci are not random, but instead are
                 enriched for genes that are connected in biological pathways
                 (P = 0.016) and that underlie skeletal growth defects (P <
                 0.001). Second, the likely causal gene is often located near
                 the most strongly associated variant: in 13 of 21 loci
                 containing a known skeletal growth gene, that gene was closest
                 to the associated variant. Third, at least 19 loci have
                 multiple independently associated variants, suggesting that
                 allelic heterogeneity is a frequent feature of polygenic
                 traits, that comprehensive explorations of already-discovered
                 loci should discover additional variants and that an
                 appreciable fraction of associated loci may have been
                 identified. Fourth, associated variants are enriched for
                 likely functional effects on genes, being over-represented
                 among variants that alter amino-acid structure of proteins and
                 expression levels of nearby genes. Our data explain

                 mice from the four replicate selected lines ran, on average,
                 twice as many revolutions per day as those from the four
                 unselected control lines. To examine whether the selected
                 lines followed distinct strategies in the correlated responses
                 of the size and metabolic capacities of the hindlimb muscles,
                 we examined mice from selected lines, housed for 8 wk in cages
                 with access to running wheels that were either free to rotate
                 (``wheel access'' group) or locked (``sedentary''). Thirteen
                 of twenty individuals in one selected line (line 6) and two of
                 twenty in another (line 3) showed a marked reduction (
                 approximately 50\%) in total hindlimb muscle mass, consistent
                 with the previously described expression of a small-muscle
                 phenotype. Individuals with these ``mini-muscles'' were not
                 significantly smaller in total body mass compared with
                 line-mates with normal-sized muscles. Access to free wheels
                 did not affect the relative mass of the mini-muscles, but did
                 result in typical mammalian training effects for mitochondrial
                 enzyme activities. Individuals with mini-muscles showed a
                 higher mass-specific muscle aerobic capacity as revealed by
                 the maximal in vitro rates of citrate synthase and cytochrome
                 c oxidase. Moreover, these mice showed the highest activities
                 of hexokinase and carnitine palmitoyl transferase. Females
                 with mini-muscles showed the highest levels of
                 phosphofructokinase, and males with mini-muscles the highest
                 levels of pyruvate dehydrogenase. As shown by total muscle
                 enzyme contents, the increase in mass-specific aerobic
                 capacity almost completely compensated for the reduction
                 caused by the ``loss'' of muscle mass. Moreover, the
                 mini-muscle mice exhibited the lowest contents of lactate
                 dehydrogenase and glycogen phosphorylase. Interestingly,
                 metabolic capacities of mini-muscled mice resemble those of
                 muscles after endurance training. Overall, our results

              increasingly realistic scenarios, forward genetic simulations
              have become a critical part of the toolbox of modern evolutionary
              biology. The SLiM forward genetic simulation framework is one of
              the most powerful and widely used tools in this area. However,
              its foundation in the Wright-Fisher model has been found to pose
              an obstacle to implementing many types of models; it is difficult
              to adapt the Wright-Fisher model, with its many assumptions, to
              modeling ecologically realistic scenarios such as explicit space,
              overlapping generations, individual variation in reproduction,
              density-dependent population regulation, individual variation in
              dispersal or migration, local extinction and recolonization,
              mating between subpopulations, age structure, fitness-based
              survival and hard selection, emergent sex ratios, and so forth.
              In response to this need, we here introduce SLiM 3, which
              contains two key advancements aimed at abolishing these
              limitations. First, the new non-Wright-Fisher or ``nonWF'' model
              type provides a much more flexible foundation that allows the
              easy implementation of all of the above scenarios and many more.
              Second, SLiM 3 adds support for continuous space, including
              spatial interactions and spatial maps of environmental variables.
              We provide a conceptual overview of these new features, and
              present several example models to illustrate their use.",

  author   = "King, Elizabeth G and Roff, Derek A",
  abstract = "In nature, resource availability varies spatially and temporally
              both within and across generations, leading to variation in the
              amount of energy available to individuals. The optimal allocation
              strategy can change, depending on the amount of resources
              available to allocate to life-history functions. If so, selection
              should favor the evolution of allocation strategies that can
              respond to variation in environmental resource levels. We address
              this issue by using two quantitative genetic simulation models in
              a model system for studying trade-offs, wing-dimorphic insects.
              Wing dimorphic insects typically exhibit a trade-off in the
              allocation of resources between migratory ability and
              reproduction. In our models, we focus on allocation as a genetic
              trait and model the evolution of phenotypic plasticity in this
              trait in response to spatiotemporal variation in resource
              availability. We show that the evolved allocation strategy
              depends on the predictability of resource levels across time.
              Specifically, selection favors higher investment in flight under
              poor conditions in predictable environments and lower investment

              a strong association between the two forms of diagnosis and

              recently developed maximum likelihood methods to investigate this

              Heritability estimates for either form of diagnosis were

  abstract  = "Within a population there are frequently several discrete
               morphs. While in some cases, particularly color polymorphisms,
               this variation can be explained by simple Mendelian modes of
               inheritance, in many cases the evidence suggests a polygenic
               pattern of inheritance. The threshold model of quantitative
               genetics, in which discrete morphs are determined by some
               underlying continuously distributed trait and a threshold(s) of
               expression, is applied appropriately in these cases. The
               discrete morphs exhibited in cyclomorphosis, pedomorphosis,
               pedogenesis, ``protective'' dimorphisms, trophic dimorphisms,
               wing dimorphism, and mating strategies can all be analyzed by
               using this model. Analyses of a wide range of different types of
               threshold traits show that there is typically a large additive
               genetic component, but that there is also strong environmental
               induction. A review of studies shows that no morph has a
               universally higher fitness, but that there is a tradeoff, with
               the relative fitnesses of two morphs being contingent upon
               environmental conditions. For example, exuberant structures that
               serve to protect organisms from predators reduce other
               components of fitness, such as development time and fecundity.
               Environmental induction is an adaptive norm of reaction, in that
               cues of current or future conditions are used to increase the
               probability that the morph produced is that which has the
               highest fitness under the expected conditions. Most models for
               the evolution of threshold traits have focused on the phenotype
               and have not addressed the crucial question of what maintains
               genetic variation, and hence permits continued evolutionary
               change. Phenotypic models show that noninducible polymorphic
               variation cannot be maintained by spatial variation alone, but
               can be favored in an environment that is temporally variable.
               Multiple phenotypes may evolve in a spatially variable
               environment if there are cues that allow the organism to assess
               the type of patch in which it is developing; thus spatial
               variation is expected to lead to the evolution of inducible
               phenotypes. Considerable genetic variation can be maintained by
               mutation, even in the face of strong directional selection.
               Frequency-dependent selection, shown to play an important role
               in the maintenance of phenotypic variation, may also be
               significant in the maintenance of genetic variation.",

  abstract  = "BACKGROUND: There are now over 2000 loci in the human genome
               where genome wide association studies (GWAS) have found one or
               more SNPs to be associated with altered risk of a complex trait
               disease. At each of these loci, there must be some molecular
               level mechanism relevant to the disease. What are these
               mechanisms and how do they contribute to disease? RESULTS: Here
               we consider the roles of three primary mechanism classes:
               changes that directly alter protein function (missense SNPs),
               changes that alter transcript abundance as a consequence of
               variants close-by in sequence, and changes that affect splicing.
               Missense SNPs are divided into those predicted to have a high
               impact on in vivo protein function, and those with a low impact.
               Splicing is divided into SNPs with a direct impact on splice
               sites, and those with a predicted effect on auxiliary splicing
               signals. The analysis was based on associations found for seven
               complex trait diseases in the classic Wellcome Trust Case
               Control Consortium (WTCCC1) GWA study and subsequent studies and
               meta-analyses, collected from the GWAS catalog. Linkage
               disequilibrium information was used to identify possible
               candidate SNPs for involvement in disease mechanism in each of
               the 356 loci associated with these seven diseases. With the
               parameters used, we find that 76\% of loci have at least of
               these mechanisms. Overall, except for the low incidence of
               direct impact on splice sites, the mechanisms are found at
               similar frequencies, with changes in transcript abundance the
               most common. But the distribution of mechanisms over diseases
               varies markedly, as does the fraction of loci with assigned
               mechanisms. Many of the implicated proteins have previously been
               suggested as relevant, but the specific mechanism assignments
               are new. In addition, a number of new disease relevant proteins
               are proposed. CONCLUSIONS: The high fraction of GWAS loci with
               proposed mechanisms suggests that these classes of mechanism
               play a major role. Other mechanism types, such as variants
               affecting expression of genes remote in the DNA sequence, will
               contribute in other loci. Each of the identified putative
               mechanisms provides a hypothesis for further investigation.",

                 exercise physiology, we conducted an artificial selection
                 experiment. From the outbred Hsd:ICR strain of Mus domesticus,
                 we began eight separate lines, each consisting of 10 breeding
                 pairs. In four of the lines, we used within-family selection
                 to increase voluntary wheel running. The remaining four lines
                 were random-bred (within lines) to serve as controls. Various
                 traits have been monitored to test for correlated responses.
                 Here, we report on organ masses, with emphasis on the triceps
                 surae muscle complex, an important extensor of the ankle. Mice
                 from the selected lines exhibit reduced total body mass,
                 increased relative (mass-corrected) kidney mass, and reduced
                 relative triceps surae mass. In addition, a discrete
                 muscle-mass polymorphism was observed: some individuals had
                 triceps surae that were almost 50\% lighter than normal for
                 their body mass. This small-muscle phenotype was observed in
                 only three of the eight lines: in one control line, it has
                 fluctuated in frequency between zero and 10\%, whereas in two
                 of the selected lines it has increased in frequency to
                 approximately 50\% by generation 22. Data from a set of
                 parents and offspring (generations 23 and 24) are consistent
                 with inheritance as a single autosomal recessive allele.
                 Evidence for the adaptive significance of the small-muscle
                 allele was obtained by fitting multiple-generation data to
                 hierarchical models that include effects of genetic drift
                 and/or selection. The small-muscle allele is estimated to have
                 been present at low frequency (approximately 7\%) in the base
                 population, and analysis indicates that strong selection
                 favors the allele in the selected but not control lines. We
                 hypothesize that the small muscles possess functional
                 characteristics and/or that the underlying allele causes
                 pleiotropic effects (e.g., reduced total body mass; increased
                 relative heart, liver, and kidney mass) that facilitate high
                 levels of wheel running. Nevertheless, at generation 22, wheel
                 running of affected individuals did not differ significantly
                 from those with normal-sized muscles, and the magnitude of
                 response to selection has been similar in all four selected
                 lines, indicating that multiple genetic ``solutions'' are
                 possible in response to selection for high activity levels.",

               typically taught in introductory plant breeding courses and are
               critical for success in upper-level study. Active learning,
               including simulations and games, may be useful for instruction
               of these concepts, which rely heavily on theory and may be more
               challenging for students. The statistical computing language R
               is now routinely used in the analysis of plant breeding
               experiments, but the command-line interface of the language may
               be unsuitable for an introductory course. Here we describe
               qgshiny (quantitative genetics in shiny), an interactive
               application for performing simulations to understand basic
               theory in quantitative and population genetics. The initial
               version of the application includes modules on three core topics
               in quantitative genetics: randomly mating populations, genetic
               variance, and response to selection. Students can specify
               parameters and initiate simulations to assess their impact on
               responses such as allele frequency, genetic variance, and
               genetic gain, which together can be used to reinforce more
               general learning objectives. Feedback collected from students

               the exponentially increasing magnitude of biological data and
               the complexity of statistical tools. However, statistical
               programming can cause anxiety in new learners and educators
               alike. In order to produce graduates that are well-prepared for
               quantitative research, overcoming the initial hurdles associated
               with statistical programming is a must. Often, valuable class
               time is dedicated to teaching introductory concepts of
               statistical programming, leaving instructors short on time. Here
               we present an introductory tutorial to statistical programming
               in the language R. Our tutorial is easily customizable,
               self-paced, and can be used in secondary through graduate level
               classrooms. Student questionnaire responses suggest that
               perceptions towards R became generally more favorable following
               an introduction to the program, with an increased likelihood of
               returning to R. Similar results were found across multiple
               formats for introducing statistical programming in R and suggest
               a tutorial-style introduction is as effective as a series of
               lectures and computer exercises for altering student perceptions
               towards statistical programming for graduate students. Our
               tutorial provides a self-paced introduction that covers basic
               programming in R and offers students an opportunity to learn the
               basic skills that often act as a roadblock to learning and
               utilizing more complex quantitative tools, while reserving class

              opportunities for practice, and immediate, individualized
              feedback). Using a pre-/post-design, we tested the ability of
              MathBench modules to improve student quantitative skills and
              their attitudes towards the integration of math and biology in a
              community college introductory biology course, where instructors
              face multiple challenges to integrating quantitative content. Ten
              sections of the course incorporated MathBench into laboratory and
              lecture content (MathBench group, N = 124 students), while five
              sections covered the same laboratory and lecture content without
              MathBench (comparison group, N = 31 students). On average,
              students who used MathBench experienced gains in their
              quantitative skills, while those in the comparison group did not.
              For students with the lowest level of preparation in math, using
              MathBench was associated with improvements in quantitative skill
              only if they were concurrently enrolled in a math class. Neither

  abstract  = "Abstract A large body of research has examined students'
               conceptions of evolution and their relationships to acceptance
               of evolution. Proficiency in statistical and probabilistic
               reasoning has long been considered to be an essential feature of
               evolutionary reasoning, yet almost no empirical work has
               explored these putative connections. The RaPro instruments have
               recently been developed to measure statistical reasoning in the
               contexts of mathematics (RaProMath) and evolution (RaProEvo).
               Our study provides additional validation of these instruments
               using Rasch analysis and quantifies the contribution of
               statistical reasoning to both understanding and accepting
               evolution. We recruited a large sample (N?=?564) of
               undergraduate students enrolled in an introductory biology
               course at a large public research university in the United
               States. Students completed a suite of published instruments that
               assessed statistical reasoning, evolutionary understanding, and
               evolutionary acceptance. Our findings indicate that validity
               inferences derived from RaPro scores generalized to the new
               sample, and that proficiency in statistical reasoning explained
               28\% of the variance in evolutionary knowledge and 19\% of the
               variation in evolutionary acceptance. The inclusion of
               demographic variables into the model significantly increased the
               explained variance in acceptance. Notably, the variance in
               evolution acceptance explained by statistical reasoning was
               comparable to that of thinking dispositions or evolutionary
               knowledge reported in the literature. This work provides the
               first large-scale evidence of the role of statistical reasoning
               in evolutionary knowledge and acceptance and motivates future
               work to explore how statistical literacy should be integrated

               there is apparently no research that explores if the reverse is
               possible. Does teaching adolescents scientifically accurate
               information about genetic variation within and between US census
               races reduce their racial biases? We randomized 8th and 9th
               grade students (n?=?166) into separate classrooms to learn for
               an entire week either about the topics of (a) human genetic
               variation or (b) climate variation. In a cross-over randomized
               trial with clustering, we demonstrate that when students learn
               about genetic variation within and between racial groups it
               significantly changes their perceptions of human genetic
               variation, thereby causing a significant decrease in their
               scores on instruments assessing cognitive forms of prejudice. We
               then replicate these findings in two computer-based randomized

               biology students (n?=?721, 9th?12th graders). These results
               indicate that teaching about human variation in the domain of
               genetics has potentially powerful effects on social cognition
               during adolescence. In turn, we argue that learning about the
               social and quantitative complexities of human genetic variation
               research could prepare students to become informed participants

              tentatively suggest that if students learn about the complexity

              article, we investigate for the first time how different types of

  abstract = "Discrete phenotypic variation often involves threshold expression
              of a trait with polygenic inheritance. How such discrete
              polyphenisms evolve starting from continuously varying phenotypes
              has received little theoretical attention. We model the evolution
              of sigmoid norms of reaction in response to variation in an
              underlying trait or in a continuous environment to identify
              conditions for the evolution of discontinuity. For traits with
              expression depending on a randomly varying underlying factor,
              such as developmental noise, polyphenism is unstable under
              constant phenotypic selection for two selective peaks, and
              reaction norm evolution results in a phenotypic distribution
              concentrated at only one peak. But with frequency-dependent
              selection between two adaptive peaks, a steep threshold
              maintaining polyphenism can evolve. For inducible plastic traits
              with expression conditioned on an environmental variable that
              also affects phenotypic selection, the steepness of the evolved
              reaction norm depends both on the differentiation of the
              environment in time or space and on its predictability between
              development and selection. Together with recent measurements of
              genetic variance of threshold steepness, these predictions
              suggest that quasi-discrete phenotypic variation may often evolve

              of schizophrenia over the past 15 years. This has revealed a
              highly polygenic condition with the majority of the currently
              explained heritability coming from common alleles of small effect
              but with additional contributions from rare copy number and
              coding variants. Many specific genes and loci have been
              implicated that provide a firm basis upon which mechanistic
              research can proceed. These point to disturbances in neuronal,
              and particularly synaptic, functions that are not confined to a
              small number of brain regions and circuits. Genetic findings have
              also revealed the nature of schizophrenia's close relationship to
              other conditions, particularly bipolar disorder and childhood
              neurodevelopmental disorders, and provided an explanation for how
              common risk alleles persist in the population in the face of
              reduced fecundity. Current genomic approaches only potentially
              explain around 40\% of heritability, but only a small proportion
              of this is attributable to robustly identified loci. The extreme
              polygenicity poses challenges for understanding biological
              mechanisms. The high degree of pleiotropy points to the need for
              more transdiagnostic research and the shortcomings of current
              diagnostic criteria as means of delineating biologically distinct
              strata. It also poses challenges for inferring causality in
              observational and experimental studies in both humans and model
              systems. Finally, the Eurocentric bias of genomic studies needs
              to be rectified to maximise benefits and ensure these are felt
              across diverse communities. Further advances are likely to come
              through the application of new and emerging technologies, such as
              whole-genome and long-read sequencing, to large and diverse
              samples. Substantive progress in biological understanding will
              require parallel advances in functional genomics and proteomics
              applied to the brain across developmental stages. For these
              efforts to succeed in identifying disease mechanisms and defining

              variants including those with weak or no statistically
              significant association. Also, a large-scale exome sequencing

               thousands of genes and genetic variants (mainly SNPs) that
               contribute to complex diseases in humans. Functional
               characterization and mechanistic elucidation of these SNPs and
               genes action are the next major challenge. It has been well
               established that SNPs altering the amino acids of protein-coding
               genes can drastically impact protein function, and play an
               important role in molecular pathogenesis. Functions of
               regulatory SNPs can be complex and elusive, and involve gene
               expression regulation through the effect on RNA splicing,
               transcription factor binding, DNA methylation and miRNA
               recruitment. In the present review, we summarize the recent
               progress in our understanding of functional consequences of
               GWAS-associated non-coding regulatory SNPs, and discuss the
               application of systems genetics and network biology in the

  abstract = "Rare cardiac genetic diseases have generally been considered to
              be broadly Mendelian in nature, with clinical genetic testing for
              these conditions predicated on the detection of a primary
              causative rare pathogenic variant that will enable cascade
              genetic screening in families. However, substantial variability
              in penetrance and disease severity among carriers of pathogenic
              variants, as well as the inability to detect rare Mendelian
              variants in considerable proportions of patients, indicates that
              more complex aetiologies are likely to underlie these diseases.
              Recent findings have suggested genetic variants across a range of
              population frequencies and effect sizes may combine, along with
              non-genetic factors, to determine whether the threshold for
              expression of disease is reached and the severity of the
              phenotype. The availability of increasingly large genetically
              characterized cohorts of patients with rare cardiac diseases is
              enabling the discovery of common genetic variation that may
              underlie both variable penetrance in Mendelian diseases and the
              genetic aetiology of apparently non-Mendelian rare cardiac
              conditions. It is likely that the genetic architecture of rare
              cardiac diseases will vary considerably between different
              conditions as well as between patients with similar phenotypes,
              ranging from near-Mendelian disease to models more akin to
              common, complex disease. Uncovering the broad range of genetic
              factors that predispose patients to rare cardiac diseases offers
              the promise of improved risk prediction and more focused clinical
              management in patients and their families.",

  abstract  = "AbstractTwin studies of dementia have typically used relatively
               simple 2 × 2 contingency tables with one threshold to estimate
               the relative importance of genetic variance for liability to
               disease. These designs are inadequate for addressing issues of
               age at onset, censoring of data, and distinguishing shared
               environmental effects from age effects. Meyer and Breitner
               [1998: Am J Med Genet 81:92–97] applied a multiple‐threshold
               model to the NAS‐NRC Twin Panel (average age of onset, 63.5
               years) and report that additive genetic effects and shared
               environmental effects account for 37\% and 35\% of the
               variation, respectively, in age of onset for Alzheimer disease.
               We apply a modified version of their model to the Study of
               Dementia in Swedish Twins (average age of onset, 75 years) and
               find that genetic effects account for 57\%–78\% of the variance,
               whereas shared environmental effects are of no importance.
               Heritability is lower when thresholds are freely estimated
               rather than fixed to the population prevalences. We interpret
               the findings to suggest that models with free thresholds
               confound influences on longevity with influences for the
               disease. Multiple‐threshold models, however, do not confound age
               effects with shared environmental influences. © 2001 Wiley‐Liss,

  abstract = "Genetic architecture of a disease comprises the number,
              frequency, and effect sizes of genetic risk alleles and the way
              in which they combine together. Before the genomic revolution,
              the only clue to underlying genetic architecture of schizophrenia
              came from the recurrence risks to relatives and the segregation
              patterns within families. From these clues, very simple genetic
              architectures could be rejected, but many architectures were
              consistent with the observed family data. The new era of
              genome-wide association studies can provide further clues to the
              genetic architecture of schizophrenia. We explore models of
              genetic architecture by description rather than the mathematics
              that underpins them. We conclude that the new genome-wide data
              allow us to narrow the boundaries on the models of genetic
              architecture that are consistent with the observed data. A
              genetic architecture of many common variants of moderate
              (relative risk > approximately 1.2) can be excluded, yet there is
              evidence that current generation genome-wide chips do tag an
              important proportion of the genetic variation for schizophrenia
              and that the underlying causal variants will include common
              variants of small effect as well as rarer variants of larger
              effect. Together, these observations imply that the total number
              of genetic variants is very large--of the order of thousands. The
              first generation of studies have generated hypotheses that should
              be testable in the near future and will further narrow the
              boundaries on genetic architectures that are consistent with

              Familial aggregation and segregation analyses based on polygenic
              threshold models have been the primary approach to fitting
              genetic models to the family data of complex diseases. In the
              current study, an advanced approach to obtaining appropriate
              causal models for complex diseases based on the sufficient
              component cause (SCC) model involving combinations of traditional
              genetics principles was proposed. The probabilities for the
              entire population, i.e., normal-normal, normal-disease, and
              disease-disease, were considered for each model for the
              appropriate handling of common complex diseases. The causal model
              in the current study included the genetic effects from single
              genes involving epistasis, complementary gene interactions,
              gene-environment interactions, and environmental effects.
              Bayesian inference using a Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithm
              (MCMC) was used to assess of the proportions of each component
              for a given population lifetime incidence. This approach is
              flexible, allowing both common and rare variants within a gene
              and across multiple genes. An application to schizophrenia data
              confirmed the complexity of the causal factors. An analysis of
              diabetes data demonstrated that environmental factors and
              gene-environment interactions are the main causal factors for
              type II diabetes. The proposed method is effective and useful for
              identifying causal models, which can accelerate the development
              of efficient strategies for identifying causal factors of complex

               state-of-the art approaches and discuss limitations and
               challenges, concluding with an overview of the current and
               future applications for GWAS results. Uffelmann et al. describe
               the key considerations and best practices for conducting
               genome-wide association studies (GWAS), techniques for deriving
               functional inferences from the results and applications of GWAS
               in understanding disease risk and trait architecture. The Primer
               also provides information on the best practices for data sharing
               and discusses important ethical considerations when considering
               GWAS populations and data.",

               the discovery of ∼700 and ∼100 nearly independent single
               nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) associated with these traits,
               respectively. Here we combine summary statistics from those two
               studies with GWAS of height and BMI performed in ∼450000 UK
               Biobank participants of European ancestry. Overall, our combined
               GWAS meta-analysis reaches N ∼700000 individuals and
               substantially increases the number of GWAS signals associated
               with these traits. We identified 3290 and 941 near-independent
               SNPs associated with height and BMI, respectively (at a revised
               genome-wide significance threshold of P < 1 × 10-8), including
               1185 height-associated SNPs and 751 BMI-associated SNPs located
               within loci not previously identified by these two GWAS. The
               near-independent genome-wide significant SNPs explain ∼24.6\% of
               the variance of height and ∼6.0\% of the variance of BMI in an
               independent sample from the Health and Retirement Study (HRS).
               Correlations between polygenic scores based upon these SNPs with
               actual height and BMI in HRS participants were ∼0.44 and ∼0.22,
               respectively. From analyses of integrating GWAS and expression
               quantitative trait loci (eQTL) data by summary-data-based
               Mendelian randomization, we identified an enrichment of eQTLs
               among lead height and BMI signals, prioritizing 610 and 138
               genes, respectively. Our study demonstrates that, as previously
               predicted, increasing GWAS sample sizes continues to deliver, by
               the discovery of new loci, increasing prediction accuracy and
               providing additional data to achieve deeper insight into complex

  abstract  = "AbstractThe SLiM software framework for genetically explicit
               forward simulation has been widely used in population genetics.
               However, it has been largely restricted to modeling only a
               single species, which has limited its broader utility in
               evolutionary biology. Indeed, to our knowledge no
               general-purpose, flexible modeling framework exists that
               provides support for simulating multiple species while also
               providing other key features, such as explicit genetics and
               continuous space. The lack of such software has limited our
               ability to model higher biological levels such as communities,
               ecosystems, coevolutionary and eco-evolutionary processes, and
               biodiversity, which is crucial for many purposes, from extending
               our basic understanding of evolutionary ecology to informing
               conservation and management decisions. We here announce the
               release of SLiM 4, which fills this important gap by adding
               support for multiple species, including ecological interactions
               between species such as predation, parasitism, and mutualism,
               and illustrate its new features with examples.",

  abstract = "We review the study of flower color polymorphisms in the morning
              glory as a model for the analysis of adaptation. The pathway
              involved in the determination of flower color phenotype is traced
              from the molecular and genetic levels to the phenotypic level.
              Many of the genes that determine the enzymatic components of
              flavonoid biosynthesis are redundant, but, despite this
              complexity, it is possible to associate discrete floral
              phenotypes with individual genes. An important finding is that
              almost all of the mutations that determine phenotypic differences
              are the result of transposon insertions. Thus, the flower color
              diversity seized on by early human domesticators of this plant is
              a consequence of the rich variety of mobile elements that reside
              in the morning glory genome. We then consider a long history of
              research aimed at uncovering the ecological fate of these various
              flower phenotypes in the southeastern U.S. A large body of work
              has shown that insect pollinators discriminate against white
              phenotypes when white flowers are rare in populations. Because
              the plant is self-compatible, pollinator bias causes an increase
              in self-fertilization in white maternal plants, which should lead
              to an increase in the frequency of white genes, according to
              modifier gene theory. Studies of geographical distributions
              indicate other, as yet undiscovered, disadvantages associated
              with the white phenotype. The ultimate goal of connecting ecology
              to molecular genetics through the medium of phenotype is yet to
              be attained, but this approach may represent a model for
              analyzing the translation between these two levels of biological
              organization.",
