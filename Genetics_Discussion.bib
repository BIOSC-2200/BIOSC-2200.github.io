  abstract    = "To study the correlated evolution of locomotor behavior and
                 exercise physiology, we conducted an artificial selection
                 experiment. From the outbred Hsd:ICR strain of Mus domesticus,
                 we began eight separate lines, each consisting of 10 breeding
                 pairs. In four of the lines, we used within-family selection
                 to increase voluntary wheel running. The remaining four lines
                 were random-bred (within lines) to serve as controls. Various
                 traits have been monitored to test for correlated responses.
                 Here, we report on organ masses, with emphasis on the triceps
                 surae muscle complex, an important extensor of the ankle. Mice
                 from the selected lines exhibit reduced total body mass,
                 increased relative (mass-corrected) kidney mass, and reduced
                 relative triceps surae mass. In addition, a discrete
                 muscle-mass polymorphism was observed: some individuals had
                 triceps surae that were almost 50\% lighter than normal for
                 their body mass. This small-muscle phenotype was observed in
                 only three of the eight lines: in one control line, it has
                 fluctuated in frequency between zero and 10\%, whereas in two
                 of the selected lines it has increased in frequency to
                 approximately 50\% by generation 22. Data from a set of
                 parents and offspring (generations 23 and 24) are consistent
                 with inheritance as a single autosomal recessive allele.
                 Evidence for the adaptive significance of the small-muscle
                 allele was obtained by fitting multiple-generation data to
                 hierarchical models that include effects of genetic drift
                 and/or selection. The small-muscle allele is estimated to have
                 been present at low frequency (approximately 7\%) in the base
                 population, and analysis indicates that strong selection
                 favors the allele in the selected but not control lines. We
                 hypothesize that the small muscles possess functional
                 characteristics and/or that the underlying allele causes
                 pleiotropic effects (e.g., reduced total body mass; increased
                 relative heart, liver, and kidney mass) that facilitate high
                 levels of wheel running. Nevertheless, at generation 22, wheel
                 running of affected individuals did not differ significantly
                 from those with normal-sized muscles, and the magnitude of
                 response to selection has been similar in all four selected
                 lines, indicating that multiple genetic ``solutions'' are
                 possible in response to selection for high activity levels.",

  abstract = "Despite enormous efforts employing various approaches, the
              molecular pathology in the schizophrenia brain remains elusive.
              On the other hand, the knowledge of the association between the
              disease risk and changes in the DNA sequences, in other words,
              our understanding of the genetic pathology of schizophrenia, has
              dramatically improved over the past two decades. As the
              consequence, now we can explain more than 20\% of the liability
              to schizophrenia by considering all analyzable common genetic
              variants including those with weak or no statistically
              significant association. Also, a large-scale exome sequencing
              study identified single genes whose rare mutations substantially
              increase the risk for schizophrenia, of which six genes (SETD1A,
              CUL1, XPO7, GRIA3, GRIN2A, and RB1CC1) showed odds ratios larger
              than ten. Based on these findings together with the preceding
              discovery of copy number variants (CNVs) with similarly large
              effect sizes, multiple disease models with high etiological
              validity have been generated and analyzed. Studies of the brains
              of these models, as well as transcriptomic and epigenomic
              analyses of patient postmortem tissues, have provided new
              insights into the molecular pathology of schizophrenia. In this
              review, we overview the current knowledge acquired from these
              studies, their limitations, and directions for future research
              that may redefine schizophrenia based on biological alterations

  abstract = "There has been substantial progress in understanding the genetics
              of schizophrenia over the past 15 years. This has revealed a
              highly polygenic condition with the majority of the currently
              explained heritability coming from common alleles of small effect
              but with additional contributions from rare copy number and
              coding variants. Many specific genes and loci have been
              implicated that provide a firm basis upon which mechanistic
              research can proceed. These point to disturbances in neuronal,
              and particularly synaptic, functions that are not confined to a
              small number of brain regions and circuits. Genetic findings have
              also revealed the nature of schizophrenia's close relationship to
              other conditions, particularly bipolar disorder and childhood
              neurodevelopmental disorders, and provided an explanation for how
              common risk alleles persist in the population in the face of
              reduced fecundity. Current genomic approaches only potentially
              explain around 40\% of heritability, but only a small proportion
              of this is attributable to robustly identified loci. The extreme
              polygenicity poses challenges for understanding biological
              mechanisms. The high degree of pleiotropy points to the need for
              more transdiagnostic research and the shortcomings of current
              diagnostic criteria as means of delineating biologically distinct
              strata. It also poses challenges for inferring causality in
              observational and experimental studies in both humans and model
              systems. Finally, the Eurocentric bias of genomic studies needs
              to be rectified to maximise benefits and ensure these are felt
              across diverse communities. Further advances are likely to come
              through the application of new and emerging technologies, such as
              whole-genome and long-read sequencing, to large and diverse
              samples. Substantive progress in biological understanding will
              require parallel advances in functional genomics and proteomics
              applied to the brain across developmental stages. For these
              efforts to succeed in identifying disease mechanisms and defining
              novel strata they will need to be combined with sufficiently
              granular phenotypic data.",

              tentatively suggest that if students learn about the complexity

              article, we investigate for the first time how different types of

               there is apparently no research that explores if the reverse is
               possible. Does teaching adolescents scientifically accurate
               information about genetic variation within and between US census
               races reduce their racial biases? We randomized 8th and 9th
               grade students (n?=?166) into separate classrooms to learn for
               an entire week either about the topics of (a) human genetic
               variation or (b) climate variation. In a cross-over randomized
               trial with clustering, we demonstrate that when students learn
               about genetic variation within and between racial groups it
               significantly changes their perceptions of human genetic

  abstract = "Introductory courses in biology often lack sufficient emphasis on
              quantitative skills and interdisciplinary problem solving,
              leaving many students unprepared for more advanced biology
              coursework and hampering their ability to pursue biology research
              careers. MathBench Biology Modules were created to enhance the
              quantitative skills of biology students by leveraging the unique
              advantages of the online environment (e.g., self-pacing,
              opportunities for practice, and immediate, individualized
              feedback). Using a pre-/post-design, we tested the ability of
              MathBench modules to improve student quantitative skills and
              their attitudes towards the integration of math and biology in a
              community college introductory biology course, where instructors
              face multiple challenges to integrating quantitative content. Ten
              sections of the course incorporated MathBench into laboratory and
              lecture content (MathBench group, N = 124 students), while five
              sections covered the same laboratory and lecture content without
              MathBench (comparison group, N = 31 students). On average,
              students who used MathBench experienced gains in their
              quantitative skills, while those in the comparison group did not.
              For students with the lowest level of preparation in math, using
              MathBench was associated with improvements in quantitative skill
              only if they were concurrently enrolled in a math class. Neither
              group of students demonstrated changes over the semester in their
              attitudes towards the integration of math and biology.
              Qualitative data indicated that MathBench group students could
              identify multiple aspects of how MathBench contributed to their
              learning, including providing new content, alternative approaches
              to learning, and additional opportunities to practice new skills.

              of students' values of mathematics in the context of biology
              (math-biology task values). To fill this gap in knowledge, we
              sought to determine 1) life science majors' math-biology task
              values, 2) how math-biology task values differ according to

               conceptions of evolution and their relationships to acceptance
               of evolution. Proficiency in statistical and probabilistic
               reasoning has long been considered to be an essential feature of
               evolutionary reasoning, yet almost no empirical work has
               explored these putative connections. The RaPro instruments have
               recently been developed to measure statistical reasoning in the
               contexts of mathematics (RaProMath) and evolution (RaProEvo).
               Our study provides additional validation of these instruments
               using Rasch analysis and quantifies the contribution of
               statistical reasoning to both understanding and accepting
               evolution. We recruited a large sample (N?=?564) of
               undergraduate students enrolled in an introductory biology
               course at a large public research university in the United
               States. Students completed a suite of published instruments that
               assessed statistical reasoning, evolutionary understanding, and
               evolutionary acceptance. Our findings indicate that validity
               inferences derived from RaPro scores generalized to the new
               sample, and that proficiency in statistical reasoning explained
               28\% of the variance in evolutionary knowledge and 19\% of the
               variation in evolutionary acceptance. The inclusion of
               demographic variables into the model significantly increased the
               explained variance in acceptance. Notably, the variance in
               evolution acceptance explained by statistical reasoning was
               comparable to that of thinking dispositions or evolutionary
               knowledge reported in the literature. This work provides the
               first large-scale evidence of the role of statistical reasoning
               in evolutionary knowledge and acceptance and motivates future

               quantitative research, overcoming the initial hurdles associated
               with statistical programming is a must. Often, valuable class
               time is dedicated to teaching introductory concepts of
               statistical programming, leaving instructors short on time. Here
               we present an introductory tutorial to statistical programming
               in the language R. Our tutorial is easily customizable,
               self-paced, and can be used in secondary through graduate level
               classrooms. Student questionnaire responses suggest that

              expressed in the form of mathematical models that can feel
              daunting and inaccessible for students and empiricists with
              variable quantitative training and attitudes towards math. A
              promising way to make mathematical models more approachable is to
              embed them into interactive tools with which one can visually
              evaluate model structures and directly explore model outcomes
              through simulation. To promote such interactive learning of
              quantitative models, we developed EcoEvoApps, a collection of
              free, open-source, and multilingual R/Shiny apps that include
              model overviews, interactive model simulations, and code to
              implement these models directly in R. The package currently

               typically taught in introductory plant breeding courses and are
               critical for success in upper-level study. Active learning,
               including simulations and games, may be useful for instruction
               of these concepts, which rely heavily on theory and may be more
               challenging for students. The statistical computing language R
               is now routinely used in the analysis of plant breeding
               experiments, but the command-line interface of the language may
               be unsuitable for an introductory course. Here we describe
               qgshiny (quantitative genetics in shiny), an interactive
               application for performing simulations to understand basic
               theory in quantitative and population genetics. The initial
               version of the application includes modules on three core topics
               in quantitative genetics: randomly mating populations, genetic
               variance, and response to selection. Students can specify
               parameters and initiate simulations to assess their impact on
               responses such as allele frequency, genetic variance, and
               genetic gain, which together can be used to reinforce more
               general learning objectives. Feedback collected from students

              contains two key advancements aimed at abolishing these
              limitations. First, the new non-Wright-Fisher or ``nonWF'' model
              type provides a much more flexible foundation that allows the
              easy implementation of all of the above scenarios and many more.
              Second, SLiM 3 adds support for continuous space, including
              spatial interactions and spatial maps of environmental variables.
              We provide a conceptual overview of these new features, and
              present several example models to illustrate their use.",

                 twice as many revolutions per day as those from the four
                 unselected control lines. To examine whether the selected
                 lines followed distinct strategies in the correlated responses
                 of the size and metabolic capacities of the hindlimb muscles,
                 we examined mice from selected lines, housed for 8 wk in cages
                 with access to running wheels that were either free to rotate
                 (``wheel access'' group) or locked (``sedentary''). Thirteen
                 of twenty individuals in one selected line (line 6) and two of
                 twenty in another (line 3) showed a marked reduction (
                 approximately 50\%) in total hindlimb muscle mass, consistent
                 with the previously described expression of a small-muscle
                 phenotype. Individuals with these ``mini-muscles'' were not
                 significantly smaller in total body mass compared with
                 line-mates with normal-sized muscles. Access to free wheels
                 did not affect the relative mass of the mini-muscles, but did
                 result in typical mammalian training effects for mitochondrial
                 enzyme activities. Individuals with mini-muscles showed a
                 higher mass-specific muscle aerobic capacity as revealed by
                 the maximal in vitro rates of citrate synthase and cytochrome
                 c oxidase. Moreover, these mice showed the highest activities
                 of hexokinase and carnitine palmitoyl transferase. Females
                 with mini-muscles showed the highest levels of
                 phosphofructokinase, and males with mini-muscles the highest
                 levels of pyruvate dehydrogenase. As shown by total muscle
                 enzyme contents, the increase in mass-specific aerobic
                 capacity almost completely compensated for the reduction
                 caused by the ``loss'' of muscle mass. Moreover, the

                 wheels (7-8 weeks) elicited a modest increase in maximal
                 oxygen consumption. Based on these results, we hypothesized
                 that genetic selection would affect the changes in endurance

                 Wheel access also increased the succinate dehydrogenase
